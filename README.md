Predictive Vulnerability Management: Using Machine Learning to Predict and Prioritize Vulnerability Exploits
Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for vulnerability management using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical vulnerability data, the model predicts the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, allowing organizations to prioritize and mitigate potential threats proactively.

Objectives
Predict Vulnerability Exploits: Use machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of vulnerabilities being exploited.
Prioritize Vulnerabilities: Provide a ranking mechanism to help security teams focus on the most critical vulnerabilities.
Enhance Cybersecurity Posture: Shift from reactive to proactive security strategies by anticipating potential threats.
Project Structure
Data Collection: Fetching data from the Vulners API and National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing data to identify patterns and insights.
Model Building: Implementing and evaluating different machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
