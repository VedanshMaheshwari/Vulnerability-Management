# Predictive Vulnerability Management: Using Machine Learning to Predict and Prioritize Vulnerability Exploits

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for vulnerability management using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical vulnerability data, the model predicts the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, allowing organizations to prioritize and mitigate potential threats proactively.

## Objectives

- **Predict Vulnerability Exploits:** Use machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of vulnerabilities being exploited.
- **Prioritize Vulnerabilities:** Provide a ranking mechanism to help security teams focus on the most critical vulnerabilities.
- **Enhance Cybersecurity Posture:** Shift from reactive to proactive security strategies by anticipating potential threats.

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection:** Fetching data from the Vulners API and National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, normalizing data, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing data to identify patterns and insights.
- **Model Building:** Implementing and evaluating different machine learning models, including Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
