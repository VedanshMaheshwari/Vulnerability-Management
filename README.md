# Vulnerability-Management
This project aims to develop a predictive model for vulnerability management using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical vulnerability data, the model predicts the likelihood of a vulnerability being exploited, allowing organizations to prioritize and mitigate potential threats proactively.
